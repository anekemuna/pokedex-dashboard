## Notes

- One major challenge I faced was with styling. 
  - I kept adding styling to the same CSS file. By the time I had gotten to styling the detail page, I used the same CSS selectors already existing and started having clashing styles. In the future, I will split the CSS into smaller files for each component.
- Creating the Charts. I got stuck a couple times while working on the charts and making the layouts more user friendly.
